# Galvanize Brews
[Live Site](https://gal-brews.herokuapp.com)

This is an assessment on [knex.js](http://knexjs.org/).

* Create *2 migrations* and *2 seeds* with the data available in the `/data` directory
* Update the `queries.js` file with the queries you will need
* Update the `beers` and `breweries` route files with calls to the queries you wrote in `queries.js`
* When you're done, you should have a site that looks [like this](http://galvanize-brews.herokuapp.com/)
* Push your site and your database to a public URL
